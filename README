Instructions for operating the scripts in this repository.

These scripts work using an exported file from TopHat's website.

To export:

Open TopHats website on your browser.
Go to the "Gradebook" for the desired course.
Click the "Open Folders" button.
Click Export.
Save as a .xlsx file in the same folder as the Course.py script.

The excel spreadsheet must be in the following format:

Row 3 should contain the titles of the questions asked.
(It will also contain several entries marked "Weight")

Row 2 should contain the lectures in which the questions were used,
the lecture should only be identified above the first question in the 
lecture. E.g. if the first question in the third lecture was entitled,
"Books", the cell above "Books" should say "Lecture 3", but no other 
question in lecture 3 should be marked this way. The lecture identifying cells
must contain the word "Lecture" or "lecture".

The questions should begin in column G. This should be done 
automatically when exporting from TopHat.

Where a student answered a question correctly, it should be marked
"1".
Where a student answered incorrectly, it should be marked "0".
If no response was given to the question, it should appear as "--".

Using the script:

The command line for performing classical test theory statistics should be as follows:

python Report.py <title of excel file> <title of file to write report to>

For PCA.py the format of input should be the same. The command line should be:

python PCA.py <title of excel file> <title of file to write report to>

Note that the files given in the command lines do NOT need their suffix explicitly stated.
